                        <p>Hey everyone! Thanks so much for checking out my website. Let me start off by saying I'm Elaine and I am from Texas. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from DeVry University and have a Bachelors of Science Degree in Multimedia Design and Web Development. I worked as a Web Designer for a financial services company, but now I'm focused on school and gaining more skills to go Front End Web Developer, aka Full Stack Developer. </p>
                        <p>During my downtime, it's the usual hanging with friends, family, going to the movies/sporting events/concerts. But the hobby that really pushes me to go further in life is punching out some killer beats on my drumset. I discovered back in June of 2018 (after performing at my very first recital) that I have an ear for music. I have been drumming for 10 months, but funny thing is, I am two months ahead in the program. I guess I am a fast learner when it comes to drums.</p>
                        <p> I love learning new things and I don't want to stop. I am learning how to play the Piano once more, and the Guitar. I have my own band, sing and write the songs.</p>
